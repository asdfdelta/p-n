# Project Description

In P-N, every project has a **Project Description** containing general information about the project. This includes the following;

- **Name**
- **Project Statement**: Up to a few paragraphs describing the end goal of the project
- **Implementation Details**: Optional; how you plan on accomplishing the end goal
- **Current State**: Up to a few sentences describing the current state of the project.
- **Braindump**: A structureless list of tiny tasks or items for further refinement.

## Name

For projects that wouldn't normally have a super snappy name, like learning how to make dovetail joints, so the name can just be something nice a concise. Whatever makes the most sense to you.

## Project Statement

This should be your full vision of the project. Make it as in-depth as you want to, **but do not use it for planning**. It's important to keep this section high-level and end-state focused.

## Impelmentation Details

The only optional field in P-N, adding *how* you're going to accomplish your project can be just as important as the project itself. Making a service to randomly generate horse facts is a great statement, but if the actual project is using an AI model combing Twitter to do it, that might be a good thing to put in here.

## Current State

Add up to a few sentences describing where the project is at. It shouldn't be immensely complex or have diagrams, but it should be enough to explain to someone familiar with the project where it is at.

## Braindump

The Braindump list can be populated with two types of items;
- Tiny tasks that don't fit into full checkpoints (e.g. send an email, ask John about Deer, etc.)
- Ideas or concepts that require further refinement into checkpoints

As long as there are items in the Braindump list, there should be a Checkpoint created to clear them all out. As you add the first item, you should also add the Checkpoint.
