# P-N; The Solo Project Management Methodology
This repo contains the documentation for The Holy Book of Project-ing.

The goal of this book is to provide a framework to manage N-number of projects while still making progress. It's meant to facilitate the organic growth of project scopes, but manage the overwhelming cognitive load and prioritize ideas.

Checkpoints
- Checkpoints are points in a project where the current status can be described in one or two sentences. As you get farther away from a checkpoint, it takes more effort to describe the status until you start getting closer to finishing it. More effort to describe the status means it's harder (and will take longer) to pick it back up after taking a break of unknown duration.
- The closer you can make it to a checkpoint before taking a break, the easier it is to transition to it later.
- Checkpoints have to be well-defined and should never expand. As new information is gathered, checkpoints can be broken down into smaller checkpoints.
- The most important checkpoint is the next one, defining all checkpoints at once isn't necessary.
- Creation of checkpoints can happen any time, but must happen upon or before completion of the previous checkpoint **without delay**.
- Checkpoints can be parallel in priority, but any potential next checkpoints must have equal definition and quality.
