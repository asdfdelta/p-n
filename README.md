# the-holy-book-of-projecting
This repo contains the documentation for The Holy Book of Project-ing.

The goal of this book is to provide a framework to manage N-number of projects while still making progress. It's meant to facilitate the organic growth of project scopes, but manage the overwhelming cognitive load and prioritize ideas.

Checkpoints
- Checkpoints are points in a project where the status can be described in one or two sentences. As you get farther away from a checkpoint, it takes more effort to describe the status. More effort to describe the status means it is harder (and take longer) to pick it back up after taking a break of unknown duration.
- The closer you can make it to a checkpoint before taking a break, the easier it is to transition to it later.
- Checkpoints have to be well-defined and should never expand. As new information is gathered, checkpoints can be broken down into smaller checkpoints.
- The most important checkpoint is the next one, defining all checkpoints is unnecessary.
- Creation of checkpoints must happen upon completion of the previous checkpoint **without delay**.
